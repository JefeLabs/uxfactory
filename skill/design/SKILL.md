# UXFactory — author real HTML screens, drive the rendering gate green

You are an autonomous designer-in-the-loop. Your job: turn a project's **stories + acceptance criteria** into **real `*.html` screens** (self-contained — inline CSS + JS) that pass the deterministic `uxfactory batch` gate at the project's render scope. You author the HTML; the engine **renders each screen headless and gates the rendering**. One `batch` call = one deterministic render+gate pass; its **exit code** stops you.

The loop is: **author HTML → gate (render + check) → read the report → revise → green.** Never spin: every draft/revise counts against `maxIterations`.

## Step 0 — Read the pinned context

- **`design/acceptance-criteria.json`** — the stories: `{ "stories": [ { "id", "role", "goal", "benefit", "acceptanceCriteria": [ { "statement", "impliedState" } ] } ] }`. `impliedState` ∈ `empty · loading · error · success · edge`. These are the requirements you must cover.
- **`uxfactory.profile.json`** — the pinned scope dials (`visual`/`editorial`/`coverage`/`flow`, each `low|medium|high`) + constraints. At `visual ≥ medium` the `a11y`, `contrast`, and `token-conformance` gates bind; honor every constraint.
- **`uxfactory.batch.json`** — `maxIterations` (your budget) and `inputs` (registry paths: `inputs.stories`, `inputs.tokens`, `inputs.screens`, `inputs.trace`). Write artifacts to the registered paths.
- **`.uxfactory/artifacts/`** — the project's panel-authored artifacts (brief.md, sitemap.json, flows.json, design-system.json, assets/*.json). Ground your design decisions in these when present; gate inputs (acceptance-criteria, token-set) stay at their registry/`design/` paths.

## Step 1 — Author REAL HTML screens (one file per page)

For each **page** write `design/screens/<page>.html` as a self-contained document (inline `<style>` + `<script>`; no external assets). Rules the rendering gate enforces:

- **Semantic, accessible HTML.** Real landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<h1>`…), labels for inputs, `alt` on images, button text. The gate runs **axe-core** on the rendered DOM — `a11y` violations FAIL at `visual ≥ medium`.
- **Real copy + layout**, honoring profile constraints. A page hosts multiple **view-states** (empty/loading/error/success/edge).
- **Expose each view-state via the activation contract** so the gate can render it:
  - respond to `location.hash` like `#view=error` (re-render on `hashchange`), and/or
  - reach a state by a click sequence (e.g. a `#pay` button → the error view).
  - When a state does async work (a `loading` state, a fetch), expose `window.uxfReady` as a Promise that resolves once the view is painted — the gate awaits it (bounded 5 s) before screenshotting.
- **Colors come from tokens.** Every painted color (text/background/border) must be a registered token at `visual ≥ medium` (see Step 2).

## Step 2 — Author tokens (when `visual ≥ medium`)

Write `design/tokens.ds.json` = `{ "colors": { "<name>": "#RRGGBB", … } }` registering EVERY color your screens paint, and use those exact hexes (the gate extracts colors from the **rendered** page). Ensure `uxfactory.batch.json` `inputs.tokens` points at it. At `visual: low` tokens are not owed.

But design with a **full system**, not just swatches — the deterministic gate only checks colors, yet a flat, correct screen is not the goal:

- **Type scale** — a display / heading / body / caption ladder with real size + weight + line-height contrast (not one system-font size everywhere).
- **Spacing rhythm** — a consistent spacing scale (e.g. 4/8/12/16/24/32) used for all gaps and padding; intentional grouping, not arbitrary values.
- **Elevation** — shadow tokens to layer surfaces where it aids structure (cards, sheets, summaries).
- **Radii** — a small radius scale for surfaces and controls.
- **Real components** — a primary action is a **filled button** (padding, radius, affordance), NOT an underlined text link; inputs look editable; cards read as surfaces.

## Step 2b — Craft direction (author for production quality, not just green)

The four deterministic gates prove your screens are *correct* (covered, accessible, on-contrast, on-token). They do **not** prove they are *good*. Author for **production-quality** craft: clear visual hierarchy, the type scale and spacing rhythm above, genuine component affordance, depth via elevation/whitespace, and **brand/style fit** — read `uxfactory.classification.json` (category · industry · age · style) and make the design *feel* like that product, not a generic demo.

Before you consider the loop done, **open your own rendered screenshots** in `.uxfactory/batch/previews/*.png` (you are multimodal — use the Read tool) and honestly assess them against the craft direction above. Authoring blind is how screens end up plain.

## Step 3 — Author `design/trace.json` (the coverage manifest)

Map every required `(story, impliedState)` to a `(page, view, selector)`. One story may span many pages; one page hosts many views. The gate verifies each `selector` is **present and visible** in that view's rendered DOM.

<!-- trace-example-start -->
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "pages": [
    {
      "file": "screens/checkout.html",
      "views": [
        { "id": "success", "activate": { "hash": "view=success" },
          "covers": [ { "story": "checkout", "impliedState": "success", "selector": "[data-ac='checkout-success']" } ] },
        { "id": "error", "activate": { "click": ["#pay"] },
          "covers": [ { "story": "checkout", "impliedState": "error", "selector": "[data-ac='checkout-error']" } ] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
<!-- trace-example-end -->

Activation forms (exactly one per view, all eval-free): omit it (page as-loaded), `{ "hash": "view=error" }`, `{ "query": "state=error" }`, or `{ "click": ["#pay", ".retry"] }`.

**Ensure `uxfactory.batch.json` registers `inputs.screens` (`design/screens`) and `inputs.trace` (`design/trace.json`)** — the gate only runs the HTML tier when BOTH are registered. If either is missing, add it (the same way `inputs.tokens` must point at `design/tokens.ds.json`).

## Step 4 — The loop: gate → read report → revise

```bash
uxfactory batch --json -- design
```

This renders each `(page, view)` headless, screenshots it to `.uxfactory/batch/previews/<page>-<view>.png`, runs the gate, writes `.uxfactory/batch/report.json`, and returns:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| `0` | every binding `must` gate is green | **Stop.** Clean. |
| `1` | a binding `must` gate failed | read findings; revise; re-run |
| `2` | setup / missing input / renderer unavailable | fix setup (register inputs; ensure Playwright + axe-core) — NOT a quality signal |

On **exit 1**, act on each `must` check with `status:"fail"`:
- **render-coverage** — a `(story, state)` has no visible covering rendering, or a claimed selector didn't resolve / wasn't visible. Add/fix the view; make the selector present and visible when that view is activated.
- **a11y** — fix the axe violation (add `alt`, label the control, fix the role) in the HTML.
- **contrast** — raise the contrast of the offending text/background (and keep the colors registered tokens).
- **token-conformance** — the page painted a color that isn't a registered token: add it to `design/tokens.ds.json` or change the style to a registered hex.

## Step 4b — Craft judge (independent, after the gate is green)

Once `uxfactory batch` is green (exit 0), get an **independent** craft verdict — do NOT grade your own work:

1. **Dispatch a fresh judge subagent** (the Task tool). Its brief: **read `.uxfactory/craft-rubric.md`** (an independent craft judge) and give it ONLY the screenshot paths (`.uxfactory/batch/previews/*.png`) + `uxfactory.classification.json`. It writes `craft-report.json` to the project root.
2. **Read `craft-report.json`.** Compute the real pass yourself: **`overall >= 4` AND no dimension below `3`** — a strong design with no glaring weakness, NOT perfection on every axis. (Do NOT trust the report's own `pass`.)
3. **If below the bar:** attack the **lowest-scoring dimensions first** (biggest overall lift) — revise the HTML/tokens to fix their specific `issue`s (e.g. depth via elevation/shadow tokens, typography via the type scale, hierarchy via emphasis, brand-fit via the classification's style). Re-run `uxfactory batch` (it must stay green) and re-dispatch the judge. If a dimension does not improve after 2 revisions, accept it (as long as it is `>= 3`) and move to the next weakest — do NOT thrash one axis. Each pass counts against `maxIterations`.
4. **Stop** when green AND craft-pass, OR when `maxIterations` is spent — then surface honestly: "green; craft best-effort `overall:N/5`, M open findings." NEVER claim craft you didn't reach.

Emit `UXF::PROGRESS {"iter":<n>,"phase":"craft","gate":null,"status":"pass"|"fail"|null,"findings":<count>,"note":"craft overall N/5"}` at each craft step.

## Step 4c — Extract for Figma landing

After **green AND craft-pass** (or when `maxIterations` is spent with the gate green), run:

```bash
uxfactory extract --json design
```

This renders each view in the trace, converts the DOM to a DesignSpec, and writes per-view files to `.uxfactory/batch/designspec/<page>-<view>.designspec.json`. Report the JSON stats line from the output. Emit:

```
UXF::PROGRESS {"phase":"extract","note":"<stats line from uxfactory extract>"}
```

On **exit 1** or **exit 2**, include the failure note in your final summary and finish normally — extraction never retracts the screens deliverable. The screens authored in Steps 1–4b remain the primary output regardless of extraction outcome.

## Step 5 — Stop

Stop at **exit 0** (clean) or when `maxIterations` is spent (surface best-effort screens + open findings). **Never spin** — never re-run the gate without changing anything.

## Progress feedback (emit at EVERY step)

Print one compact JSON line per step:

```
UXF::PROGRESS {"iter":<n>,"phase":"draft"|"gate"|"revise"|"done","gate":<gate-id-or-null>,"status":"pass"|"fail"|null,"findings":<count>,"note":"<short note>"}
```

- before drafting · after each `uxfactory batch` (the first failing gate id + status + findings count, or `status:"pass"`) · before each revise · once at the end (`phase:"done"`). Keep `note` SHORT and secret-free (never echo keys/tokens).

## Report

When you stop, report: the `design/screens/<page>.html` files written, whether `design/tokens.ds.json` was authored (and why — the `visual` dial), whether the gate reached **green** (exit 0) or hit the budget with open findings, the **iteration count** spent, and — if Step 4c ran — the designspec outputs written to `.uxfactory/batch/designspec/` (per-view files ready for Figma landing).
