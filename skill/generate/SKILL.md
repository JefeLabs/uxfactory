# UXFactory — Draft One UX Artifact

You draft **a single UX input artifact** for an already-classified project and write it to the exact path the registry expects, so the deterministic `uxfactory batch` gate can read it. You author the content; the engine stays LLM-free and only gates.

You will be told a **target**, the **target path**, optional **seed refs**, and the **constraints** to honor. Produce exactly that one artifact — do not generate others, do not run the batch, do not pin the profile.

## Targets — pick the one you were told

The pipeline panel drives three seeded workstreams via a `target`. Draft **exactly one**, matching the target you were handed:

| Target                 | Draft                                                  | Underlying artifact            | Seeds (honor the given `seedRefs`)            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `user-story`           | the user-story narratives                              | `AcceptanceCriterion` (stories) | the project classification                    |
| `acceptance-criteria`  | testable acceptance criteria for the **seeded stories** | `AcceptanceCriterion`          | the upstream **story** refs in `seedRefs`     |
| `user-journey`         | a user journey / `UserFlow` spanning the **seeded stories** | `UserFlow`                  | the upstream **story** refs in `seedRefs`     |

When `seedRefs` are given (e.g. story ids `S-1`, `S-2`), every criterion or journey step you draft must **trace back to one of them by name** — acceptance criteria reference their story; a journey's steps span the seeded stories. If `seedRefs` is empty, you are the upstream/seed job: draft from the classification alone.

## Step 1 — Read the pinned context

Read the project's classification and derived profile so your draft matches the scope and constraints:

```bash
uxfactory classify --json   # GateProfile: scope (four dials) + manifest + constraints
```

Also read these if present (use the Read tool):

- `uxfactory.classification.json` — the committed classification vector.
- `uxfactory.batch.json` — `inputs.{stories,tokens,flow}` register the expected path for each artifact kind. **Write to the registered path** for your kind.

The `constraints` array on the profile (e.g. accessibility targets, reading-level limits, disclosure or privacy obligations forced by industry/age) is **non-negotiable**. Every artifact you draft must satisfy them.

## Step 2 — Draft the one artifact

Match the artifact kind to its shape and the depth implied by the scope dials:

### AcceptanceCriterion — `inputs.stories` — serves `user-story` and `acceptance-criteria`

A JSON array of stories. Each story has an `id` and acceptance criteria naming the view-states it owns. Cover the states the `coverage` dial demands (success only at `low`; add empty / loading / error at `medium`; all edge states at `high`). Keep story ids stable and filename-safe — the gate traces them by name.

- For `target: user-story`, draft the **story narratives** (stable ids + a clear narrative per story), seeded by the classification.
- For `target: acceptance-criteria`, draft the **testable criteria for the stories named in `seedRefs`** — each criterion references its seed story id so `coverage-orphans` can trace it. Do not invent stories that are not in `seedRefs`.
  - **Merge, never replace.** `user-story` and `acceptance-criteria` write the **same** `inputs.stories` file. The `user-story` job ran first and authored the story narratives. So for `acceptance-criteria` you MUST first **Read** the existing `AcceptanceCriterion` JSON, then **attach** your criteria to the matching seeded stories *in place* — preserve every existing story's `id` and narrative verbatim, and keep stories you were not asked about untouched. Never overwrite the stories array wholesale; doing so destroys the upstream job's work.

### TokenSet (design tokens) — `inputs.tokens`

A JSON token set: color, type, spacing, radius. Every color a spec fills or strokes must exist here — `token-conformance` binds at `visual >= medium` and matches by registered token. Honor any contrast obligation in the constraints.

### UserFlow — `inputs.flow` — serves `user-journey`

A JSON flow: named steps and the transitions between them. Each step name should match the frame/node it refers to. Cover the paths the `flow` dial demands (single screen at `low`; the primary end-to-end path at `medium`; branches, back/cancel, and deep-links at `high`). `flow-reachability` binds at `flow >= medium`.

For `target: user-journey`, the journey must **span the stories named in `seedRefs`** — name the steps after the seed stories' screens/states so the flow stays traceable to them.

Author for **traceability**: story ids in frame names, state keywords in node names, registered token colors, real step names. The gate matches on names.

## Step 3 — Write it to the registered path

Write the drafted artifact as JSON to the path you were given (the registry's `inputs.<kind>` entry). Create parent directories if needed. Do not overwrite a different artifact kind, and do not touch committed inputs you were not asked to draft.

**When your target shares a file with an upstream target** — `acceptance-criteria` writes the same `AcceptanceCriterion` file as `user-story` — **Read the existing file first and merge into it**: add your content to the existing entries, preserving everything already there. Only when the file is absent (you are the first/seed job) do you write it fresh.

## Step 4 — Report

Tell the user, briefly:

- which artifact kind you drafted and the exact path you wrote;
- which `derived_from` dimension forced it (provenance) and which constraints you honored;
- that the artifact is a **draft** for review — they should inspect it, then run the Confirm gate and `uxfactory batch` themselves.

Draft **one** artifact, honestly. If the classification or constraints are ambiguous, state the assumption you made rather than inventing requirements.
